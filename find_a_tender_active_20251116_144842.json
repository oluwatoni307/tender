The bringing of court proceedings against the Authority during the standstill period will automatically continue the prohibition on entering into the framework agreement until the court proceedings are determined, discontinued or disposed of, or the court, by interim order, brings to an end the prohibition. The remedies that may be awarded by the courts before the framework agreement has been entered into include the setting aside of the decision to award the framework agreement to the winning tenderer(s). The bringing of court proceedings against the Authority after the framework agreement has been entered into will not affect the framework agreement unless grounds for the imposition of special penalties under the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015 can be established. Otherwise, the remedies that may be awarded by the courts where the framework agreement has been entered into are limited to the award of damages."

The bringing of court proceedings against the Authority during the standstill period will automatically continue the prohibition on entering into\nthe framework agreement until the court proceedings are determined, discontinued or disposed of, or the court, by interim order, brings to an end the prohibition. The remedies that may be awarded by the courts before the framework agreement has been entered into include the setting aside of the decision to award the framework agreement to the winning tenderer(s). The bringing of court proceedings against the Authority after the framework agreement has been entered into will not affect the framework agreement unless grounds for the imposition of special penalties under the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015 can be established. Otherwise, the remedies that may be\nawarded by the courts where the framework agreement has been entered into are limited to the award of damages."

Tenders are asked to provide their company\nnumber within the SPD to allow the Authority to access a Credit Safe Report. Within such reports, the risk of business failure is expressed as a score of 30 or below (high risk of business failure). In the event that a company is determined to have a risk failure rating of 30 and below i.e. that the company is considered to have a high risk of business failure, the submission will not be considered further. If you are successful in the award of this contract and your risk failure rating falls below 30then the SPA reserve the right to remove you from this contract. It is the Contractor\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the information held by Credit Safe is accurate and up to date.

The Authority expressly reserves the right:\n(i) not to award any DPS Agreement as a result of the procurement process commenced by publication of this notice; and\n(ii) to make whatever changes it may see fit to the content and structure of the tendering competition; and in no circumstances will the customer be liable for any costs incurred by the suppliers.\n(iii) to make changes to the management charge applicable to this DPS in relation to both the percentage charged and the methodology used.\nWe consider that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (\"TUPE\") may apply at the Competition Procedure.\nIt is the Supplier\u2019s responsibility to take  their own advice and consider whether TUPE is likely to apply in the particular circumstances of the contract and to act accordingly.\nCCS and the Buyer reserves the right to include selection criteria to assess compliance with PPN 04/15 Past Performance in further competitions run from this DPS. CCS will assess whether the selection criterion in the PPN is met on request from the DPS user prior to the proposed conclusion of an order contract with a total value of \u00a320 million or greater (excluding VAT).  Failure to meet the selection criteria will render the Supplier ineligible for that order contract.\nOn 2.4.2014 Government introduced its Government Security Classifications (GSC) scheme which replaced Government Protective Marking Scheme (GPMS). A key aspect is the reduction in the number of security classifications used. All bidders should make themselves aware of the changes as it may impact on this requirement. The link below to Gov.uk provides information on the GSC at:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications.\nCyber Essentials is a mandatory requirement for central government contracts which involve handling personal information or provide certain ICT products/services. Government is taking steps to reduce the levels of cyber     security risk in its supply chain through the Cyber Essentials scheme. The scheme defines a set of controls which, when implemented, will provide organisations with basic protection from the most prevalent forms of threat coming from the internet. To participate in this procurement, bidders must be able to demonstrate they comply with the technical requirements prescribed by Cyber Essentials, for services under and in connection with this procurement.\nThe Housing DPS OJEU value has been increased due to the extension of the agreement until 2029 to allow market stability, and a continuation of customer access to the existing commercial agreements as a potential route to market.\nplease note that this DPS has been extended and the end date is now 23/02/2025.  In addition to this the value has also increased and this is now \u00a31,500,000,000",

A session will equate to 3.5 hours and it is anticipated that 2 patient appointments will be made in an hour, which equates to approximately 7 patients per session. There is no maximum patient limit. This would be for the service to manage capacity and to maximise patient access within clinical governance.\nThe number of patients seen in a session will be dependent upon their treatment complexity, following clinical assessment by the dentist/Dental Clinical Professional.\nThe model focuses on the integration of general medical and dental services for vulnerable patients, to further improve access to dental services in an area of high need and to tackle health inequalities by creating an alliance between a Primary Medical Provider that holds a General Medical Services Contract and a Dental Provider that can hold an NHS Dental Contract in Peterborough.\nThe Contracting Authority's assessment of each potential provider's submission has taken into account the basic selection criteria and the following key criteria:\n\u2022 Quality and innovation;\n\u2022 Value;\n\u2022 Integration, collaboration and service sustainability;\n\u2022 Improving access, reducing health inequalities and facilitating choice; and\n\u2022 Social value.",

Tenderers may be required to provide their current Employers Liability Insurance certificate which should include name of the insurers, policy numbers, expiry date and limits for any one incident and annual aggregate caps and the excesses under the policies.\nPublic Liability Insurance = 5 million GBP in respect of each claim without limit to the number of claims.  Tenderers may be required to provide a copy of their current Public Liability Insurance certificate.\nProduct Liability Insurance = 5 million GBP in respect of each claim and in the aggregate.  Tenderers may be required to provide a copy of their current Professional Indemnity Insurance certificate.\nDocumentation requested for the above insurances should include name of insurers, policy numbers, expiry date and limits of any one incident and annual aggregate caps and the excesses under the policies.\nSPD Question 4B6 Financial Standing:\nThe Authority will access a Credit safe report for a Tenderers organisation and use the information contained within to assist with the assessment of the Tenderer\u2019s economic and financial standing.  Tenders are asked to provide their company number within the SPD to allow the Authority to access a Credit Safe Report.\nWithin such reports, the risk of business failure is expressed as a score of 30 or below (high risk of business failure). In the event that a company is determined to have a risk failure rating of 30 and below i.e. that the company is considered to have a high risk of business failure, the submission will not be considered further.\nIf you are successful in the award of this contract and your risk failure rating falls below 30 then the SPA reserve the right to remove you from this contract.  It is the Contractor\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the information held by Credit Safe is accurate and up to date.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the SPA will request a report from Credit Safe following the closing date for the receipt of the Tenders to ensure that the most up to date information is used. Where you are not registered on credit safe e.g. charitable organisations or new start companies/ Sole Traders with less than 3 years trading history, discretionary powers are available to the Director of Finance to consider abbreviated accounts along with bankers references etc.\nTenderers should be aware that any outstanding County Court Judgements will have a detrimental effect on the rating held by Credit Safe and it is your responsibility to ensure that the information held by Credit Safe is accurate and up to date - failure to do so will result in rejection of your submission.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This requirement is not applicable to Sole Traders/ Charities. Sole Traders/ Charities may be required to provide a bankers reference if successful.",
