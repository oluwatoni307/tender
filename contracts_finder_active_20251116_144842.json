This includes a determination if any ground contamination has occurred during the life of the contract.\r\nThe sites that form MWDA&#039;s operational estate were leased to the WMRC Contractor upon its commencement in 2009. The Authority wishes to employ a suitably qualified and experienced contractor to determine and assess the potential for, or presence of, contamination associated with the operations carried out during the contractual term of the WMRC.\r\nThe Authority wishes to undertake this work in two distinct phases. First, a desk-based study to determine if the sites are at risk of additional contamination as a result of the operations undertaken throughout the duration of the WMRC.\r\nA second intrusive phase, which will be tendered separately, will be undertaken where necessary and based on the findings of the desk study for each of the sites. This will entail the investigation, collection and analytical testing of samples as deemed necessary during the Preliminary Contamination Risk Assessment.",

      "description": "\u2022\tSolar panel inverters should be inspected and maintained at least once a year by a qualified professional. This annual check-up is to ensure the inverter is functioning correctly, identify potential issues early, and prevent costly repairs. A more frequent inspection (e.g., bi-annually) may be necessary in some areas of the WRC which will be left to the discretion of the inspector. This is based on potential high pollution levels and weather conditions on the roof. \r\n\u2022\tManufacturer&#039;s specific recommendations for our inverter models should always be referred to and referenced in documentation, as they may have unique guidelines for maintenance and inspection\r\n\u2022\tAll inspections and maintenance performed by qualified professionals. We request members of our in-house engineering team oversee as much of the inspections as possible so they can understand what to look for on routine inspections of these plant areas.\r\n\u2022\tA full visual inspection of every solar panel will be needed to highlight damaged or faulty panels. \r\n\u2022\tAs well as inspections we expect full electrical certs to be issued with each yearly inspection. \r\n\u2022\tWe would also need a budget cost to come in the same day the solar panels are being cleaned twice a year to isolate them the process and re energise once the clean is complete. \r\n This opportunity has been distributed on adamprocure.co.uk",
